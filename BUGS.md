## problem : only first replication phase passes successfuly

### solution - we can try to somehow make the second created replicator one of replicators so they wont stick to each other immedietly after replication

## problem : some blobs attach to the wrong side of the replicator

### solution - we can try to break the plane into two different sides of the replicator and check to attach only on one side
